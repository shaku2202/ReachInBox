# Email Parsing and Response Tool

## Overview
This tool is a TypeScript-based application designed to parse and check emails in Google and Outlook email IDs, respond to emails based on context using AI, and use BullMQ as the task scheduler. It integrates with OpenAI for email context analysis and response generation.

## Features
1. **OAuth Integration:** Integrates OAuth access to Gmail and Outlook for secure email access.
2. **Email Context Analysis:** Utilizes OpenAI's API to understand the context of incoming emails and assign automatic labels (Interested, Not Interested, More Information).
3. **Automated Replies:** Generates and sends automated replies based on email context using OpenAI's API.
4. **Task Scheduling:** Implements BullMQ as the task scheduler for efficient task management.
